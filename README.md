We are unique in offering trade and communications oversight and regulatory reporting on a single platform, but our ability to make sense of both structured and unstructured data truly sets us apart.

With SteelEye, compliance and ops teams no longer need to spend hours performing manual searches across disparate systems to gather basic facts. SteelEye provides advanced analytics that serve firms with relevant information from their data â€“ telling them what they need to know before they have even asked the question.

SteelEye supports three primary compliance activities. We have clients that opt for our full offering, others use one or two of our services:

- Communications Oversight: We can integrate almost any communications channel and store that data for easy retrieval and analysis.

- Trade Oversight: Our trade oversight services and surveillance tools analyse your trading activity and enable you to identify and mitigate financial crime and market abuse risks. We also offer Transaction Cost Analysis.

- Regulatory reporting and analytics: Using our data capabilities as a foundation, we support a range of regulatory reporting obligations with robust automation and unparalleled accuracy rates. Our drag-and-drop report builder allows users to create custom data views for internal reporting and/or customer use.
